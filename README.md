## Dragon Listing BBCode Generator ##

**This is the official new home of the Dragon Listing BBCode Generator for Flight rising!**
(I'm very new to using Github, so please forgive me. >u<)

This is a joint project between myself and my husband, EternalJedi. He did 90% of the coding, and I did the layout.

To bein, this program does not modify the site, download assets, or otherwise interact with the site in any way. It only takes information you provide and adds it to create the scrying workshop, buy, and dragon lair page urls, as well as the image for the dragon itself.

In the near future, all builds of this program will come from here. If you see this program available for download anywhere else, especially behind a paywall,  **do not download it**. 

This program is free to use, forever! Tips are appreciated, but NEVER required. [You can send us a Ko-Fi here!](https://ko-fi.com/mattsykun). 
Alternatively, I do accept tips in gems, treasure, materials, and fish (oh my god I have so many dragons that eat seafood) [You can find my Flight Rising profile here!](https://www1.flightrising.com/clan-profile/310323)

The Dragon Listing BBCode Generator logo is (c) MattsyKun/The Cream Gravy. You are not permitted to use or modify the logo in any way. (The Click Here to scry button was also made by me, but using FR graphics, so feel free to like. Steal that, at least?)

## Prerequisites ##

Windows. That's it. This has not yet been tested on Windows 11.

## Installation ##

Just slap this bad boy on your desktop and you're good to go. Right now, the program will export text files containing your code onto the desktop (See our Future Roadmap below to see what changes we have in store in future builds!).
Because this program creates files on your desktop, please whitelist it with your antivirus. You may have to re-whitelist this with every update (Until we include checking for updates. See our Future Roadmap!)

Windows Defender MAY ask if you want to run this program. You may also have to run this as an administrator.

## What it do, though? ##

Here's the fun part! OwO This program ONLY needs your input; it will fill in the blanks in the code, and export a text document you can simply copy and paste said BBCode into the forums. After not playing FR for several years, I had quite a bit ot get caught up on, so buckle in!

* Dragon ID: This is used to generate the dragon's image (The same you'd see if you clicked on the dragon in the lair), as well as the link to buy and scry! No more putting in the image URL, we do that for ya. OwO
* Dragon's Name: If your dragon has a name, put it here! Otherwise, use "Unnamed" (Leaving this blank throws the layout off a bit)
* Pair Name: If your dragon comes from a hatchery, that's where this goes. Otherwise, it can be left blank.
* Hatchday: [HAPPY BIRTHDAY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__xdaj422b8) Your dragon's hatchday! For people who like dragons hatched on specific days.
* Modern or Ancient Button: This not only includes the respective icon in the listing, but will you the respective lists of modern and ancient dragons and their genes.
* Breed: You'll get modern breeds if you select the modern button, and ancient breeds if you select ancient.
* Element: The dragon's element. Necessary for the eye color as well.
* Eye Type: Self-explanatory.
* Gender: You'll have a checkbox for if the dragon is under the effect of a Silhouette scroll later.
* Colors & Genes: Remember when I said if you select ancient, you'll get the ancient breeds? Well, if you select a specific ancient breed (ie. Veilspun), you'll get only that breeds genes. Cool, huh? You can also begin typing the color or gene to autocomplete and filter through. That was an amazing last-minute discovery.
* MONEY. If you only want to accept one type of payment, the other must say 0.

Then all you gotta do is hit export! The program (for now) creates a file on your desktop containing your bbcode. You can review this code before pasting it into the forums! Then make your money, bestie!

**For MAC Users:** You will have to use Wine, a program that allows you to run .exe programs on your Mac. We don't own a Mac so this is how it gotta be. :P (Thanks to @missnanners!) 

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

Q: It won't export!
A: Make sure you have whitelisted this program with your antivirus, as well as running it in Administrative Mode.

Q: Where did it save the BBCode?
A: On your desktop. It will be a .txt document with the dragon's name as the title.

Q: It says I have an error!
A: IDK how, but you broke it. [Send me a message](https://www1.flightrising.com/msgs/new?to=CreamGravy) and We'll look into it!

Q: Why this instead of a Google Sheets thing?
A: Because I'm terrible with Sheets. I also prefer the ease of a form like this rather than a google doc. I've tried lol

Q: Will you make this a website/mobile app/for mac/linux/etc?
A: Most likely not. We don't know any other programming languages, and...yeah. Nah. XD

Q: Have you added X yet?
A: We will push an update relatively shortly after a new breed/gene update (Please give us some time after a new breed to add everything).

## FUTURE BUILD ROADMAP ##

This little section is all things we're going to look into and do for future builds!

* Color-coded color dropdown! Eventually, we will color-code the colors just like how FR has it. This will probably in the next build.
* Copying to clipboard and/or previewing your code: We'd love for you to just copy it from a textbox, like with Google Sheets. This is a little more involved, so give us some time on this.
* Checking for updates: We're DEFINITELY looking into a button that will let you check for updates!
* Dark Mode: Bear with me on this. I did this for a project back in HIGH SCHOOL. I do NOT remember how to do it now. :P
