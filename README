##Dragon Listing BBCode Generator##

**This is the official new home of the Dragon Listing BBCode Generator for Flight rising!**
(I'm very new to using Github, so please forgive me. >u<)

This is a joint project between myself and my husband, EternalJedi. He did 90% of the coding, and I did the layout.

To bein, this program does not modify the site, download assets, or otherwise interact with the site in any way. It only takes information you provide and adds it to create the scrying workshop, buy, 
and dragon lair page urls, as well as the image for the dragon itself.

In the near future, all builds of this program will come from here. If you see this program available for download anywhere else, especially behind a paywall,  **do not download it**. 

This program is free to use, forever! Tips are appreciated, but NEVER required. [You can send us a Ko-Fi here!](https://ko-fi.com/mattsykun). 
Alternatively, I do accept tips in gems, treasure, and fish (oh my god I have so many dragons that eat seafood) [You can find my Flight Rising profile here!](https://www1.flightrising.com/clan-profile/310323)

## Prerequisites ##

Windows. That's it. This has not yet been tested on Windows 11.

## Installation ##

Just slap this bad boy on your desktop and you're good to go. Right now, the program will export text files containing your code onto the desktop (See our Future Roadmap below to see what changes we have in store in future builds!).
Because this program creates files on your desktop, please whitelist it with your antivirus. You may have to re-whitelist this with every update (Until we include checking for updates. See our Future Roadmap!)

Windows Defender MAY ask if you want to run this program. You may also have to run this as an administrator.

## What it do, though? ##

Here's the fun part! OwO This program ONLY needs your input; it will fill in teh blanks in the code, and export a text document you can simply copy and paste said BBCode into the forums. After not playing FR for several years, I had quite
a bit ot get caught up on!
